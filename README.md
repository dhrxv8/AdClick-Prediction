# AdClick Predictor

Utilizing logistic regression to unveil insights and predict user engagement with online advertisements, based on comprehensive behavioral and demographic data.

## Overview

The AdClick Predictor is designed to harness the power of logistic regression to analyze and predict whether an internet user will click on an advertisement. By examining features such as daily time spent on site, age, area income, and daily internet usage, this project aims to provide valuable insights for optimizing ad targeting strategies and enhancing user engagement.

## Features

- **Predictive Modeling**: Uses logistic regression to forecast ad click-through rates.
- **Data Analysis**: Deep dive into user behavior and demographic patterns affecting ad engagement.
- **Insightful Visualizations**: Leverages matplotlib and seaborn for intuitive data visualization.
- **Efficient Data Handling**: Implements pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing.
